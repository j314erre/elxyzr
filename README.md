Notes
----------

Installation:

* npm install johnny-five
* npm install serialport
* node app.js


Usage
-----

The app connects to your local mongo database on startup.  You should have mongo running first, or it will throw an error.  The web interface is located at http://localhost:3000 (or if you are connecting via a different device, you can point that device to http://x.x.x.x:3000, the IP address of the machine that the node.js app is running on).
